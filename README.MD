# Atmel MCU Programming Notes  
## This repo contains codes for different Atmel MCUs
1. Only save simple test/experimental code when using any MCU for the first time
2. If MCU is used in a different project, a seperate repo is used

## Interrupt

1. ISR() Macro  
	2. interrupt vector table can be found in the datasheet  
	3. When programming, pre-defined interrupt vector can be found in IO definition file; i.e C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Studio\7.0\Packs\atmel\ATtiny_DFP\1.0.68\include\avr\iotn841.h
		pre-defined vector uses address(found in the datasheet) for the lookup table
